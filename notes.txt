Funcube

Issues:

- identify which sound device corresponds to which hid device
- on beaglebone Angstrom linux, with funcubes attached to a USB hub,
  the following will work:

  - libhid via libusb returns a path like 0001:000c:02
    where 0001 = bus # of HUB
          000c = device address of an FCD
            02 = control endpoint

    Unfortunately, the device addresses are chronologically assigned, and don't
    consistently correspond to physical slots on the hub.

    However (hurray!), we can perform this match as so:

    for x in /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.[1-7]; do echo -n $x " "; cat $x/devnum; done

    which prints a list like:

        /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.1  12
        /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.3  13
        /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.5  14
        /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1.7  15

    so that, for example, the device in phyiscal slot 5 has been given libusb address 14.
